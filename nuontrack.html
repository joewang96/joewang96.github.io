			<h3 class="case-study--content--title">My first interaction design project</h3>
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">Back in the fall of my second year at Northeastern I took my first interaction design course where I was also exposed to my first taste of web tech (HTML, CSS, and Javascript). The course was designed to teach us the <strong>basics of web design, designing interfaces to be used by humans, and responsive design best practices</strong>. To do so, we embarked on an almost two month assignment where we were to design a responsive website with an underlying function (i.e. had to have interactive elements for a potential user).</p>

			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">After being assigned the project I immediatley decided on redesigning the Northeastern co-op search portal where students would look for and apply to potential co-ops on. It was a system I started using that semester and which I found infuriating to use. The design was definitley not mobile friendly, and links were unable to be opened in new tabs. Overall there were a slew of problems to tackle, making it the perfect project. The final part of the project was to create either an interactive prototype, via services like InVision, or a coded version of the site. Since I was very much interested in learning web development, <strong>I opted to code my entire project, without any prior experience</strong>. Below are final screenshots of the end result.</p>

			<h3 class="case-study--content--title">Self reflection and what I'd improve</h3>
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">Looking back on this project it is obvious that it was early on in my journey as a designer. However, this project was <strong>my first venture into both interaction design and web development</strong>, and shows the passion I had to learn and grow my skillset. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, and even tought myself basic Javascript to help enhance the site. I watched YouTube tutorials on web design basics, and came out of the process with a finished project I was proud of.</p>
			
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para m-bottom-30">The concept of redesigning the Northeastern co-op search platform is still of great interest to me, and with my current skillset I believe I could greatly improve upon this first iteration. If I were to do so I would build out a back-end and enhance the front-end with a framework such as React or Vue to create a more professional and polished experience. </p>

				<p>Created as a final project for my Interaction Design 1 course, <strong>NU:OnTrack is a take on Northeastern's Co-op search web portal</strong> that is revamped with responsive design as well as an improved user experience. The site keeps with the brand of Northeastern, and the mobile first perspective makes sure it <strong>transitions cross-platform.</strong></p>

				<h3 class="section-title">The Task at Hand</h3>
				<p>Through my <strong>Interaction Design: Responsivness course</strong>, I was tasked with creating a web page for an application, real or fake, that worked across all devices. After using Northeastern's Co-op search portal, NuCareers, I decided to try and revamp that site, since it is often a pain to use for many students.</p>
				<p>The main changes I wanted to make were to make the site <strong>accessible on mobile devices</strong>, <strong>easy to navigate and find specific functionality</strong>, and to reorganize the hierarchy of the site in a way <strong>more intuitive to current students</strong>. Additionally I wanted to try and keep the site somewhat in-line with the Northeastern brand, since it would be a resource used by the University in theory.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section pad-bottom justified right" id="process">
				<h3 class="section-title">The Design Process</h3>
				<p>Before designing the site, <strong>I started brainstorming the different use cases</strong> - creating <strong>personas to help understand user needs</strong>. The list I came up with had the following tasks as priorities: view new job listings, manage and review current submissions and documents, and applying to jobs quickly and easily.</p>
				<p>After creating my initial list of percieved needs and core functionality, I developed wireframes to draft the navigation and design of the site. Once completed, <strong>I started user-testing to get feedback from actual students</strong> at Northeastern. This process was very enlightening and helped revise my designs to accommodate for what I hadn't thought of.</p>
				<p>With feedback in hand, I began creating the digital designs directly with HTML and CSS. Throughout the process I kept my stylings clean, eliminating redundant declarations wherever necessary. Each section took multiple iterations to get to a point where I was pleased, but in the end came together to create a cohesive website.</p>

		<!-- Results Section -->
		<div class="container-pad flex-parent light-gray">
			<div class="section pad-bottom" id="results">
				<h3 class="section-title text-center">Final Results</h3>
				<p>At the end of the process I came up with a revamped Northeastern Co-op search site, dubbed <strong>NU:OnTrack.</strong> The site was much easier to use than the current site, and held up across devices. While the direct functionality of the site wasn't implemented, <strong>I created mock actions</strong> such as uploading documents, logging in, and applying for co-op positions which <strong>helped showcase the potential user experience.</strong></p>
				<p>NU:OnTrack is certainly better than the exisitng solution of NuCareers, however I would like to revisit and update the project at a later date. The project was created during my second year, and I have learned much since then. My <strong>goals for future iterations would be to create real functionality</strong>, most likely <strong>achieved through PHP and MySQL or the MEAN stack.</strong> Until then, the current site is live on my Github, and accessible through the link below.</p>

			<h3 class="case-study--content--title">Beginning of the project and ideation</h3>
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">Motiv8 is the final product of my semester long project from my human computer interaction course. The idea behind it was to come up with a platform or app that had a core user group and was designed with usability in mind. For this project I worked in a group of four, including myself. Each of us had a background in computer science, with myself and one of the other members also having a background in design. While working on the project I assumed the role as project manager, guiding the group and taking charge of presenting our work.</p>
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">The first step in the project was coming up with an idea to base our product around. Initially we decided to use one of my ideas, which was based around the idea of a <em>"social contract"</em> where users could form a pact to complete given tasks and hold each other accountable for. However, that later evolved into a commitment based motivation platform, with a focus on collaborative goals rather than assigning each other responsibilities. Both concepts had a similar concept of a social platform to help increase accountability, however the latter allowed more flexibility in terms of use cases and was more likely to be used by actual individuals.</p>

			<h3 class="case-study--content--title">Defining personas and task analysis</h3>
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">After finalizing our concept for the platform, our next goal was to creat the user personas and formulate an approximation of the average use case using <em>hierarchical task analysis</em> diagrams. We decided our primary users would be college students our own age, both because they would be more likely to adopt a social web platform and that we would be able to find enough of that demographic to conduct our interviews with. Each persona revolved around the user wanting to make a lifestyle change, whether it be small like going to the gym with a friend as a sort of new years resolution, to a larger goal such as quiting smoking.</p>
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">With our personas in mind we began thinking through the high level tasks that they would need to complete when using our system. This step took many iterations to get right, having to narrow our scope with what we would be able to get done in the allotted time frame. Finally, we came up with our three main actions in the system: creating a commitment, managing a commitment, and congratulating a user on their success towards a shared commitment. Below is an example HTA diagram we created as well as a picture from our brainstorming session.</p>

			<h3 class="case-study--content--title">Paper prototyping and first usability tests</h3>
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">Before starting on either the development process or creating higher fidelity designs, our group created a paper prototype to be used during an initial round of usability tests. These tests would help us identify any glaring issues in our system before we spent time and effort building it out. Additionally, we started testing early in order to give us a chance to do more testing later on, getting feedback at multiple stages of the cycle.</p>
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">From the usability tests we found that users were able to follow along with the tasks given to them, with the majority being able to complete two of the three primary tasks very quickly. However, the main issue we found was that users were unfamiliar with the concept of a <em>commitment</em>, and thus did not know what to fill out when creating it in the interface. After observing this pattern emerge, we made sure to setup the idea in the final designs, giving more context for each input field in order to guide the user throught the process.</p>

			<h3 class="case-study--content--title">Development path and refined designs</h3>
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">In terms of deciding how to logistically create Motiv8, I suggeseted the idea of using a combination of Flask as the "back-end" and framework for the larger application and Vue.js to manage the front-end. Both of which I was previously familiar with, with one of my teammates being familiar with React and was down to learn a new system. For full disclosure, both him and I worked on the entirety of the system, picking up the slack for our other two team members who had no experience in web tech. Regardless, we decided to push on through, delegating other tasks such as future write-ups to the other team members to make sure we kept the project moving forward.</p>
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">During our development cycles we refined our interface designs, shifting features around, coming up with brand colors, and creating a rough system for the tone we wanted our platform to portray. We ended up using blue as the primary color of the brand, playing into the idea of trying to create a calm and collaborative enviornment. We opted to keep the controls large and use negative space since we wanted to clean up what could potentially be a crowded interface. The tones we decided on were <em>fun</em>, <em>polished</em>, and <em>organized</em> - trying to have our system primarily in the background having the interaction between users being the focus.</p>

			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para">After a full semester of design, iterative development, and usability testing we ended up with a project that we were proud to share. We were able to deploy our prototype to the web on the team-members's server, which helped push the idea that Motiv8 was close to being a real system.</p> 
			<p class="section--body case-study--content--para m-bottom-30">We presented our process and findings of the user tests to our peers and professor, both of which were impressed by our attention to detail and design skills (since most were back-end developers). If given the opportunity we would have liked to build out a more finished back-end that allowed for persisted data, as well as expanded on the interactions between users.</p>

				<h3 class="section-title">Minimalist Weather - Vue.js &amp; Python Flask</h3>
				<p>A <strong>clean and simple</strong> solution to the popular idea of a weather app. Choosing to forgo visually intense graphics and a screen dump of information, I created this web application to give the user useful information about the current weather and display it in a way that is <strong>easy to understand</strong>.</p>

				<h3 class="section-title">The Design Process</h3>
				<p>When I began this project I had a design concept in mind for the landing page of the web app. Since most users I talked to listed speed and efficiency as important factors to them, I made the two location options as <strong>clear and simple as possible</strong>. However, designing the data view state proved more difficult than expected. Initially I had the idea of incorporating a large weather icon and temperature card to quickly convey to the user both the relative temperature and the main weather condition. However, this design seemed a little too cluttered and was very similar to existing applications.</p>
				<p>Upon <strong>multiple iterative design cycles</strong>, I finally settled on a design for the data view that I liked. Opting to move away from the "graphic with icon" direction, I instead decided to make the data as easy to understand as possible, <strong>transforming the data into a few concise sentances</strong>. To further aid the user in being able to quickly understand the data, I added color codes to the text to help with differentiation. Addtionally, I incorporated a dynamic color gradient on the temperature text, moving from blue to red as the temperature increases.</p>

				<h3 class="section-title">The Development Process</h3>
				<p>Right off the bat I knew I wanted to incorporate <strong>Vue.js</strong> into this project. The framework is relativley lightweight and is perfect to handle state transitions and data-driven views. I opted to use <strong>Python's Flask framework</strong> as the back-end due to it's simplicity and my familiarity with it. The app works by sending the user's requested location information to the weather API and transmitting the returned data back to the Vue element. Once the data is returned, the state and data update and the view is automatically refreshed.</p>
				<p>The development aspect of the project was more straightforward than the design, needing less iteration due to the main data being pulled from at most two API's - the weather data and the geolocation data for current location requests. Once I had the final design changes solidified and working locally, I pushed the project to Github and <strong>deployed the repo to a Heroku instance</strong>.</p>

				<h3 class="section-title">Music Editor - Java</h3>
				<p>The Music Editor is a Java app <strong>which allows users to load, edit, and playback music they create</strong>. The user can expand and rescale the window, as well as scroll through the track via the arrow keys as well as the scrollbars. Additional features include being able to jump to the start or end of the song, pause and resume whenever necessary, and even <strong>add or remove notes at whim!</strong></p>

		<!-- "The Task"/Intro Section -->
		<div class="container-pad flex-parent flex-column">
			<div class="section text-left justified left" id="task">
				<h3 class="section-title">The Task at Hand</h3>
				<p>Given as a task in my <strong>Object-Oriented Design</strong> course, the purpose of the project was to familiarize students with new software design concepts and patterns, particularly the <strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern</strong>. The project consisted of multiple parts, in which we built the different aspects of the software application, improving upon at the previous iteration at each step.</p>
				<p>Each student developed their own version of the program, and then was paired up with another to create the best version they possibly could. When I was paired with my partner we realized that <strong>my design pattern allowed for the components to be swapped out more easily</strong>, and the model was more intuitive for in terms of what a measure or note was. Thus, my version became the base of the project.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section pad-bottom justified right" id="process">
				<h3 class="section-title">The Development Process</h3>
				<p>After the individual attempt and being paired up, the development process began to complete the final version of the project. Not knowing what the tasks down the road would be, my partner and I <strong>planned out the necessary parts of the project, as well as key details to remember</strong>. The most important detail that came out of the brainstorming session was making sure that each component was seperate, and able to be swapped out if need be (since again, the main purpose of the assignment was to utilize the MVC pattern).</p>
				<p>The process as a whole went smoothly, with us splitting the work and bringing it together at various steps along the way. I was <strong>responsible for creating the various aspects of the View (both the auditory and visual representations)</strong>, as well as handling the keyboard. My partner dealt with setting up communication between the Controller and Model, and we both shared responsibility in fixing any bugs found in previous steps of the cycle.</p>

		<!-- Results Section -->
		<div class="container-pad flex-parent light-gray">
			<div class="section pad-bottom" id="results">
				<h3 class="section-title text-center">Final Results</h3>
				<p>After completing the multiple Views and setting up the Controller, my partner and I were able to link everything together, and the project was finally finished. At the end we produced a program which can dynamically load in notes from a file, read and play audio at real time, as well as allow for direct user control at any point. Additionally users could add notes directly inside the program, <strong>eliminating the need to have to load a new file each time</strong>.</p>
				<p>However, we were surpised with one final task - <strong>having to switch Views with another team</strong>. Since our components were designed to do just that, we had no issue passing our View along to another team. The team which recieved our View had <strong>no issues with our code</strong>, and were able to complete that task easily. However, <strong>the View which we recieved was written poorly</strong>, and key aspects didn't allow for use to swap it in as is, one being a lack of separation from View and Controller. Once the other team reworked it with appropriate separations, it was able to fit in with out program spectacularly.</p>
